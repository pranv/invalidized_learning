# invalidized_learning
Learning to differentiate between valid and invalid data.
Given image is split into tiles and localized shuffling is applied.
Then this shuffled image is smoothened along margins of tiles to ensure model doesn't detect edges.
Further translation and rotation is applied to the image to ensure efficient learning.
